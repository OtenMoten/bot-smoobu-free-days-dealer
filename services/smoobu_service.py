    üè® Smoobu Service

    This class provides high-level operations for interacting with the Smoobu API,
    abstracting the complexity of API calls and data processing.

    üîë Key Features:
    - Fetching user information
    - Retrieving and processing reservation data
    - Organizing bookings by apartment

    üîó Dependencies:
    - Relies on an APIClient implementation for making API requests
    - Uses various DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes for structured data handling

    üõ†Ô∏è Usage:
    This service is typically used by higher-level components of the application
    to retrieve and process Smoobu-related data.

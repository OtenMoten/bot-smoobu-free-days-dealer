    üåê Smoobu API Client Implementation

    This class provides a concrete implementation of the APIClient interface
    specifically for interacting with the Smoobu API. It includes features such as
    rate limiting, caching, and error handling.

    üîë Key Features:
    - Rate limiting to comply with API usage restrictions
    - Caching of API responses to reduce unnecessary requests
    - Custom error handling for common API issues

    üõ†Ô∏è Configuration:
    The client uses the following configuration parameters:
    - API_BASE_URL: The base URL for the Smoobu API
    - API_KEY: The authentication key for accessing the API
    - CACHE_EXPIRATION: The time-to-live (TTL) for cached responses
    - RATE_LIMIT: The maximum number of API calls allowed per second

    üîó Usage:
    This client is typically used within the SmoobuService to interact with the Smoobu API,
    fetching data such as reservations and user information.

        üîç Perform a GET request to the specified Smoobu API endpoint.

        This method implements rate limiting and caching to optimize API usage.
        It also handles various error scenarios, raising appropriate custom exceptions.

        Args:
            endpoint (str): The API endpoint to send the GET request to.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the API response data.

        Raises:
            RateLimitExceeded: If the API rate limit is exceeded.
            AuthenticationError: If there's an authentication problem.
            SmoobuAPIError: For other API-related errors.

        üîí Rate Limiting:
        The method is decorated with @sleep_and_retry and @limits to ensure
        compliance with the API's rate limiting policy.

        üíæ Caching:
        Responses are cached to reduce API calls. Cached responses are returned
        for subsequent requests to the same endpoint within the cache TTL.

        üí° Note:
        This method handles common HTTP errors and translates them into
        custom exceptions for easier error handling in the application.

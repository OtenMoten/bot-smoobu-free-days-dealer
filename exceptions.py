    üö´ Base exception class for Smoobu API errors.

    This exception serves as the parent class for all Smoobu API-related exceptions.

    - Subclass this exception for more specific Smoobu API error types.

    Example:
    ```python
    try:
        # Smoobu API operation
    except RateLimitExceeded:
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 60 seconds before retrying
